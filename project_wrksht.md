## Project Worksheet

## Scope: 

What are you planning to build? What is the name of your application. What technologies do you plan to use? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the allotted time period? What are your reach goals?


PupNup is the dog co-owning app of the future. This app will be a platform for co-owners to track data regarding their pets important information, medical needs, and associated chores in order to allieve the pain point of co-owner communication. Consider it a full-fledged pet management platform. In order to build an app that is able to capture user information, dog information, user authorization, and manage a shared to-do list I will be using React.js, Node.js, and Express. 
If time permits, I then plan on creating a secondary version with React Native.


## User Stories: 

Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project schedule in GitHub Project. Write out your user stories in the README. 


My user is new and existing dog owners who share their pet with a partner, family, or friends. They realize that a lot goes into dog ownership, and that becomes even more complicated with the involvement of multiple parties. Users would engage with PupNup to become a centralized location for sharing of dog-related information and responsibilities. 




## Wireframes: 

What does MVP look like? Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a paper prototype to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
